Answer when n = 100 and c= 10 : 513946235090696089113
Answer when n = 1000000 and c= 200 : 4876116127

Time complexity is O(n) (Linear)

Execution Times

With Parallel Processing :

 N = 1000000 and c = 200 ==> 2781  ms
 N = 10000000 and c = 200 ==> 24351  ms


Without Parallel processing

N = 1000000 and c = 200 ==> 5454  ms
N = 10000000 and c = 200 ==> 54099  ms

After considering abouve it seems parallel processing is a good approach when the n reach very high number.
